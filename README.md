DtBom is a simple PCB/Schematic component "manager" software. (Image at the end of page.)

There are hundreds of components on a bigger PCB/schematic. When you order the components form an webshop, you have to select those one by one, update your BOM list, etc.

DtBom simplifies this process:
1. Export the part-list or component-list from your PCB/schematic designer software and import it into DtBom.
2. Select a component on the left side, the search page of your favorite webshop will appear on the right side.
3. Choose the right component on the right side, by clicking the red SELECT link. (You can select different components from different shops.)
4. Export BOM separately by webshops. (Or later export a "quick upload" file, which you can upload/add to the basket on the webshop.)

Latest version is v0.2.0. This is NOT stable yet. Do NOT use for important project!
DtBom is under development, if you found a bug, have a good idea for a new feature or your favorite webshop doesn't supported: write to the Issue page or send me a message.
