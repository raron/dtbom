DtBom is a simple PCB/Schematic component "manager" software. (Image at the end of page.)

There are hundreds of components on a bigger PCB/schematic. When you order the components form an webshop, you have to select those one by one, update your BOM list, etc.

See wiki page: https://github.com/raron/dtbom/wiki

DtBom simplifies this process:<br/>
1. Export the part-list or component-list from your PCB/schematic designer software and import it into DtBom.<br/>
2. Select a component on the left side, the search page of your favorite webshop will appear on the right side.<br/>
3. Choose the right component on the right side, by clicking the red SELECT link. (You can select different components from different shops.)<br/>
4. Export BOM separately by webshops. (Or later export a "quick upload" file, which you can upload/add to the basket on the webshop.)<br/>
<br/>
Latest version is v0.2.0. This is NOT stable yet. Do NOT use for important project!<br/>
DtBom is under development, if you found a bug, have a good idea for a new feature or your favorite webshop doesn't supported: write to the Issue page or send me a message.
